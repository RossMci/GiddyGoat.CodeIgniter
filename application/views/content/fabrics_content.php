            A textile[1] is a flexible material made by creating an interlocking network of yarns or threads, which are produced by spinning raw fibres (from either natural or synthetic sources) into long and twisted lengths.
            [2] Textiles are then formed by weaving,
            knitting, crocheting, knotting,
            tatting, felting, bonding or braiding these yarns together.
            The related words "fabric"[3] and "cloth"[4] and "material" are often used in textile assembly trades (such as tailoring and dressmaking)
            as synonyms for textile. However, there are subtle differences in these terms in specialized usage. A textile is any material made of the interlacing fibres, 
            including carpeting and geotextiles, which may not necessarily be used in the production of further goods, such as clothing and upholstery. 
            A fabric is a material made through weaving, knitting, spreading, felting, stitching, crocheting or bonding that may be used in the production of further products,
